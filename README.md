# AdventOfCode2018

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code 2018 coding challenges using Python.

## Navigation
A file named \<X>.\<i>.py was the ith problem on day X of the coding challenge. The input files are named in a similar fashion, with name input<X>.txt corresponding to the input file on day X.
  
## Code Quality
I am well aware that these solutions are not entirely understandable. I hope to hone my skills making readable code, so at some point I may go back and improve not only the readability, but also the efficiency and clarity of the algorithms used.
